# READ ME - Horiseon Website </h1>

<p>User Story<p/>

<ul>
<li>AS A marketing agency</li>
<li>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards</li>
<li>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines</li>

<p>Acceptance Criteria </p>
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Updates:

HTML Changes -> Accessibility and Search Engine Optimisation Optimization:

Changed website tittle to Horiseon - before was "website";
Added alt text on images and icons for SEO and accessibility;
Removed the heart emoticon from the footer - added the word "love" instead for accessibility;

.CSS stylesheet changes.

Removed unused CSS - which includes removing excess classes, ids and elements;
Margins on the * tag changed to auto to center the content.


I added device width to the head meta HTML to improve readability on mobile and added a meta discription to help with general SEO.


Added a max width of 1100px (larger than any individual element) to the * css tag to keep the content sized correctly on desktop view.
added a relitive position to the body css and a fixed position to the header tag. My goal was to keep the navigation prominant to help with accesability.
